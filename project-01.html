    <h1>Wyatt Kopelman</h1>
    <p>I am a sports reporter and a two-time graduate of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>

    <p>During my time at Miami, I served UMTV as a sports anchor and was also a play-by-play broadcaster at WVUM 90.5 FM, the school's student radio station for 3 1/2 years.</p>


    <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
    <p>A dynamic, focused individual with three years of experience in broadcasting and media relations in summer collegiate baseball. Knowledge in television broadcast writing and studio production. Builds relationships on establishment of credibility, accuracy in reporting and decision making, and open-mindedness toward achieving goals. Additional skills involve video shooting and editing, graphic design, document layout formatting, sports writing and photography. A humble, enthusiastic, accountable leader who has been acknowledged by peers for completing broadcast preparation, baseball media relations tasks and broadcast television packages and writing on time, in a fast-paced setting.

    <h2>Places worked in the broadcast industry:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>UMTV</li>
        <li>WVUM</li>
        <li>Harwich Mariners: Cape Cod Baseball League</li>
        <li>Duluth Huskies: Northwoods League</li>
        <li>Lakeshore Chinooks: Northwoods League</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Television Reporting Coverage</h2>

    <p>My experience in covering Division I college athletics and local news for a television audience ranges across an array of assignments. From a profile on Miami men's basketball's Final Four coach to the tradition of a military-grade obstacle course, "Soldier Rush" on Veteran's Day, I have prioritized the value of timely reporting and story production for UMTV and look to generate this in a professional atmosphere. This fall, I also shot, edited and produced a 13-minute short documentary of Miami basketball's first-ever Final Four run. It was more than just another challenge, but a dream come true.</p>

    <h2>How my passion for covering sports started</h2>

    <p>Growing up in New York City, I was surrounded by some of the most storied teams in professional sports, and behind them, highly passionate fanbases with minute levels of patience and what felt like dozens of the industry's finest team network broadcasters and writers. Whether it involved finding a column in the New York Post on the playoff futility of the New York Knicks, or turning the radio dial for talk on the growth of Eli Manning's unshakable legacy, understanding the immense pressure — and even at times, doubt — from New York's fanbases didn't require much perusing. But upon my decision to leave the northeast for Coral Gables, the importance of consistency in college athletics coverage for an award-winning college TV station galvanized me into upholding the same work ethic I observed from other peers. In a setting valued around industry-standard story coverage, I soon learned the decision I had made was the most beneficial I had made in my life, before I had even decided to stay to pursue a master's degree.</p>
    
    <h2>Radio Broadcasting</h2>

    <p> Although I have done a diverse level of broadcast packages for UMTV's weekly newscast, "NewsVision," I have also broadcast nearly 100 games across five sports at Miami for WVUM. Some of the most memorable came in the past three years.

    <h2>Professional Goals</h2>

    <p>Because of the experience-grounded nature of the broadcast journalism industry, I remain focused on pursuing a role in sports reporting for a local news station, or in broadcast and media relations for a baseball organization in Minor League Baseball.</p>
