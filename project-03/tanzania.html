            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <article id="introduction">
            <p>Tanzania contains some of Africa&#39;s most iconic national parks and famous paleoanthropological sites, and its diverse cultural heritage reflects the multiple ethnolinguistic groups that live in the country. Its long history of integration into trade networks spanning the Indian Ocean and the African interior led to the development of Swahili as a common language in much of east Africa and the introduction of Islam into the region.</p>
            
            <p>Beginning in the mid-1800s, European explorers, traders, and Christian missionaries became more active in the region. The Germans eventually established control over mainland Tanzania - which they called Tanganyika - and the British established control over Zanzibar. Tanganyika later came under British administration after the German defeat in World War I.</p>
            
            <p>Tanganyika gained independence from Great Britain in 1961, and Zanzibar followed in 1963 as a constitutional monarchy. In 1964, a popular uprising overthrew the Sultan in Zanzibar and either killed or expelled many of the Arabs and Indians who had dominated the isles for more than 200 years.</p>

            <h2>People and Society</h2>
            <article id="people-and-society">
                <p>Tanzania has the largest population in East Africa and the lowest population density; more than a third of the population is urban.</p>

                <p>Tanzania&#39;s youthful population &#8212; over 60% of the population is under 25 as of 2020 &#8212; is growing rapidly because of the high total fertility rate of 4.4 children per woman, as of 2022. Progress in reducing the birth rate has stalled, sustaining the country&#39;s nearly 3% annual growth rate.</p>
        
                <p>Malaria is a leading killer of children under 5, while HIV is the main source of adult mortality.</p>

            <p>Nationality: Tanzanian</p>

            <h3>Languages Spoken:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Swahili</li>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>Arabic</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Migration Trends</h3>

            <p>For Tanzania, most migration is internal, rural to urban movement, while some temporary labor migration from towns to plantations takes place seasonally for harvests. Tanzania was Africa&#39;s largest refugee-hosting country for decades, hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Great Lakes region, primarily Burundi, over the last fifty years.</p>
    
            <p>Tanzania is increasingly a transit country for illegal migrants from the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region who are heading to southern Africa for security reasons and/or economic opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Energy Production</h2>

        <article id="energy-production">
            <p>Involving per capita energy use, Tanzania's energy consumption per year was last recorded at 6,522,440,000 kWh as of 2019, according to the CIA World Factbook.</p>

        <h3>Electricity Access</h3>

        <p>The consumption of electricity is considered as a struggle for more than half of Tanzanian residents by 2021, according to the CIA World Factbook.</p>

        <p>Over a nine-year timeframe, Tanzania&#39;s <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/tanzania/electricity">electricity distribution has increased more than twofold</a> which is evident through its natural gas production.</p>
